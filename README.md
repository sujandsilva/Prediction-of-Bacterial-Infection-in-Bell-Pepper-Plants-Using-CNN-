# Prediction-of-Bacterial-Infection-in-Bell-Pepper-Plants-Using-CNN-
In this project, I have developed a CNN model to detect defects in aero-engine images with an accuracy of 87.97% and evaluated the model with a validation accuracy of 80.26%, significantly enhancing predictive maintenance capabilities.                                   
I have implemented data preprocessing techniques including image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model performance and to simplify the data handling and processing steps
